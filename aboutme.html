                    <h1>Hello!</h1>
                    <p>I am Rhea Seth. With a foundation from Pratt Institute, New York, I’ve shaped my practice around designing for empathy—where every detail is intentional, and every interaction tells a story. I see design as more than just visuals; it’s a language of connection, shaped by empathy and intent.
                     Originally from New Delhi, I’ve also lived in Mumbai and New York, experiences that have shaped my perspective as a designer. While studying at Pratt, I freelanced as a 3D designer and worked as a Teaching Assistant, honing both my creative and technical skills. After graduating, I moved back to India and joined a digital advertising startup, where I’ve learned firsthand how design and business go hand in hand. Here, I’ve gained a deep understanding of marketing ideas and turning designs into profitable assets—bridging creativity with strategy has been key to my growth.
                     Outside of work, I love to paint and do photography. I’m also deeply passionate about scuba diving and have helped restore coral reefs in the Andaman's, an experience that strengthened my connection to the ocean. My love for animals runs just as deep—meet my pup, Spock!</p>
